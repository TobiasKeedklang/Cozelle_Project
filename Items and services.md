#### Barbed armor
Barbed armors are a design of armor fashioned after the Legion of knights whom served the ell√© of barbs. These pieces of armor have barbs both on the inside and outside of the plating, causing pain to both the wearer and attacker. The barbed armor holds the body of the user intact enough to fight no matter the injury. They are however exposed to worse searing by heat.
#### Coral armor
Armor worn by astral paladins or the titans of the orgottian coast. Originated from the orgottian mollae culture and became a cultural symbol for the Morogettian kingdom. This armor is still worn along the orgottian coast till this day.
