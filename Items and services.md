#### Barbed armor
Barbed armors are a design of armor fashioned after the Legion of knights whom served the ellé of barbs. These pieces of armor have barbs both on the inside and outside of the plating, causing pain to both the wearer and attacker. The barbed armor holds the body of the user intact enough to fight no matter the injury. They are however exposed to worse searing by heat.
#### Coral armor
Armor worn by astral paladins or the titans of the orgottian coast. Originated from the orgottian mollae culture and became a cultural symbol for the Morogettian kingdom. This armor is still worn along the orgottian coast till this day.

| potion of greater invisibility | 2'000 gp  | This potion's container looks empty but feels as though it holds liquid. When you drink it, you become [invisible](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Conditions?expansion=0#toc_7) for 1 hour. Anything you wear or carry is invisible with you. The effect ends early if you attack or cast a spell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Potion of climbing             | 180 gp    | When you drink this potion, you gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed for 1 hour. During this time, you have advantage on Strength ([Athletics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics)) checks you make to climb. The potion is separated into brown, silver, and gray layers resembling bands of stone. Shaking the bottle fails to mix the colors.<br><br>Notes: Set: Innate Speed (Climbing), Advantage: Athletics, Buff, Movement, Consumable                                                                                                                                                                     |
